# About Me
I am a PhD candidate at the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Alexander Vladimirsky. My research interests are optimal control of randomly switched systems and applications. Before Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in math at Harvey Mudd College, where I benefitted greatly from the liberals arts college environment. I also passionate about teaching and math education, including topics such as metacognition, universal design for learning, and inclusive grading strategies. I will be on the job market for the 2023-2024 academic year. A PDF version of my CV can be found 
[here](assets/Gee_CV_10-24-23.pdf). 


Outside of mathematics some of my hobbies and interests are knitting, classical singing, reading sci-fi/fantasy novels, and playing video games. If you are in the Ithaca area, you can see me perform with the Ithaca Community Chorus and Chamber Singers ([upcoming concert schedule](https://acithaca.org/groups/icccs/tickets/)).
